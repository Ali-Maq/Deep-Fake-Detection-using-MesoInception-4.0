Neural nets are one of the best ways to classify images with high accuracy.On
increasing the number of layers accuracy of the model increase up till a point and
then starts diminishing due to feature reuse.Also increasing the number of layers
leads to increasing the number of parameters which makes the model slower to
train. To reduce the aforementioned problems we inside widen the neural network
which also increases the accuracy and also applying data transformation and data
augmentation techniques to contribute to the accuracy. We train our model using
the CIFAR10 data set which has 50000 images for training.We also use hyper pa-
rameter optimization to help increase the accuracy while keeping the total number
of parameters below the specified limit of 5M(4,977,226).
